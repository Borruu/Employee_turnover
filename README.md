# Title of Project: What makes employees leave: A tale of two organisations

# Team Members: Brianna O'Connor, Shannon Chen

# Project Description: The cost of hiring, training and onboarding new employees often exceeds the cost of retaining existing workers. Despite this, most organisations tend to turn a blind eye to what might be causing their best and brightest to leave. 

# In this project, we seek to uncover what factors contribute to staff attrition in two separate anonymised organisations. We have come up with a set of research questions about how factors such as salary, tenure, department, duration in a specific role, and job role may influence an employeeâ€™s intention to leave. From our analysis of the data, we also hope to examine whether similar factors and trends emerge across both organisations.

# Datasets used:

# 1) EmployeeAttrition.csv (renamed from 'train_data.csv). Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavan9065/predicting-employee-attrition?select=train_data.csv
